# Beyond The 100

We cannot possibly cover all the features of the ColdFusion Engines in this book as our focus was more on the core CFML language.  However, please note that the engines offer a tremendous middle-ware capabilities that extend beyond normal language features.  There are many areas that make ColdFusion one of the most \(if not the most\) **rapid application development \(RAD\)** languages around.

Check out the [cfdocs](https://cfdocs.org/) and the engine documentation sites for all the different capabilities they can offer.
